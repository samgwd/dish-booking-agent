# Pull Request and Code Review Practices

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Draft PRs
- **Create draft PRs soon after picking up a ticket**
- Update the remote draft branch regularly (CI/CD failures are acceptable for drafts)
- Use draft PRs to share progress and get early feedback
- Convert to ready for review only when the PR is complete

### PR Descriptions
- **Use the PR template define in the .github folder**
- When using `type: ignore` or `noqa` directives:
  - **Justify their use in the PR description**
  - Explain why the ignore was necessary
  - Describe if you considered alternative approaches
  - Example: "Added `type: ignore` on line 45 because mypy doesn't recognise the dynamic attribute from the third-party library. Investigated using a protocol but it would require extensive refactoring."

### PR Size and Scope
- Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized
- Split large changes into multiple PRs when possible
- Include relevant tests for new functionality
- Update documentation when adding new features
