# Python Coding Standards

Follow these coding practices for all Python code:

## Style Guide
- Follow **Google's Python Style Guide**: https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html
- Use **100 characters** as the maximum line length (not 88)
- Use British English spelling in comments, docstrings, and variable names

## Variable Naming
- **Never use single letter variable names**
- Rare exceptions only for variables local to a single line when absolutely necessary
- Use descriptive, meaningful names that clearly indicate the variable's purpose

## Comments
- **Inline comments should be rare** and used sparingly
- Comments should explain **why** something is done, not **what** is being done
- Use inline comments only for:
  - Explaining non-obvious, complex logic
  - Providing additional context that isn't clear from the code
  - Explaining business logic or domain-specific requirements

## Code Quality
- Avoid `type: ignore` and `noqa` directives unless absolutely necessary
- When using `type: ignore` or `noqa`:
  - Ensure it's genuinely necessary
  - Consider if refactoring could avoid the need for it
  - Add justification in the PR description
  - Add inline comment if the reason isn't obvious from context

## Examples

**Good variable naming:**
```python
user_email = get_user_email()
total_revenue = calculate_revenue(transactions)
is_authenticated = check_user_authentication()
```

**Bad variable naming:**
```python
e = get_user_email()  # Too short
x = calculate_revenue(transactions)  # Meaningless
flag = check_user_authentication()  # Too generic
```

**Good comment usage:**
```python
# Calculate tax using the current fiscal year rates (updated annually)
tax_amount = gross_amount * TAX_RATE

# Retry logic needed due to intermittent API timeouts
for attempt in range(3):
    try:
        response = api_call()
        break
    except TimeoutError:
        if attempt == 2:
            raise
        time.sleep(2 ** attempt)
```

**Bad comment usage:**
```python
# Calculate tax amount
tax_amount = gross_amount * TAX_RATE  # This comment explains what, not why

# Loop through items
for item in items:  # Unnecessary comment
    process_item(item)
```
